# TS-Extractor
An interactive graph visualization system to enable users to extract, analyze and expand relevant subgraphs.

Demo video: http://jalamao.top/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/TS-Extractor.mp4

Our input is a large graph that contains thousands or more nodes and has node attributes (i.e., semantic information).

The major goal of this project is to help the user explore a large graph by extracting a subgraph (context) relevant to the user-specified nodes (called focus nodes). The extracted subgraph should contain as many nodes sharing the same/similar attribute values with the focus nodes as possible, which can provide the user with clear semantics.
